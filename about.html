	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<p>The South Newark Civic Association was first formed in 1999 as a block watch group. Citizens concerned about juvenile crime in the neighborhood came together to be additional eyes and ears for the police department. The group was active for a period of time then went dormant. The South Newark Civic Association was re-launched in the fall of 2011 to address neighborhood pride, neighborhood identity and bring attention to the need to encourage people to volunteer to make positive change. The curvy rail spike in our emblem represents the neighborhood's relationship to the railroad and the waterways that flow throughout South Newark. The SNCA became a recognized 501(c)3 charitable organization in June, 2013.</p>
