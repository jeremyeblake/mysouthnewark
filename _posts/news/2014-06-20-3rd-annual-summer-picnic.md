The South Newark Civic Association will be hosting our 3rd Annual Community Picnic planned for June 14, 2014 from noon to 2:00 PM at the Moose Lodge Shelter House, 235 W. National Drive, Newark. Everyone is welcome and please bring a side dish to share!

We are asking that high school graduates RSVP by calling 740-404-4881. We want to have a special gift for each graduate. But again, this is open to all residents.
