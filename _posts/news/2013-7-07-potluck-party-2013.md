This is an open informational meeting to hear the results of TCE testing from the basements of resident's homes.

Dr. Tessa Carrel and her students will be reporting their findings from testing the air in the basement of neighbors on Maholm Street, S. Williams Street, S. Pine Street and James Street.

The Ohio Department of Transportation has been working directly with some residents but other people in the neighborhood are concerned about TCE in their homes. Dr. Carrel and her students are working with these residents. While the test is a student project, the resident can use the results to determine if professional testing is needed.

All are welcome to attend this meeting. If you have any questions please call Jeremy Blake at 740-404-4881.
