You are invited to participate in an open discussion about the Canal Market District on April 23rd. During this phase of planning, it is extremely important to gather community input for this project. You, along with the rest of the community, will be able to make your mark on the future of Downtown Newark. Light refreshments will be provided by Skorpios Gyros!

Please RSVP with Bryn Bird at (740) 377-8886 or bryn@canalmarketdistrict.org
