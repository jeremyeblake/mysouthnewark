On Friday July 25, the Works Museum welcomes all South Newark neighbors to join a family gathering that will feature music in the courtyard, creative art spaces for young children, and the opening of new art exhibits. The theme for the evening is "Story Tellers: The Art of the Story Book". Book illustrations and showing kids how to draw and paint will be some of the fun activities. The entire Works Museum will be open to the public. The event hours are 4:00 pm to 8:00 pm.
