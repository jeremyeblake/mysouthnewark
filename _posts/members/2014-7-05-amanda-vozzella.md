Amanda primarily lived in the south end of Newark growing up, and is proud to be a part of the community. In the fall of 2011, she began attending meetings where residents came together to discuss how to engage more in the south end community. Through talking with others and hearing the passion behind the vision of others she committed herself to being part of the South Newark Civic Association. She currently is the Vice President. She lives in Columbus with her husband, cat and dog, but travels to Newark each day as Director of Programming at the Y.E.S Clubhouse and to spend time with friends and family members.
