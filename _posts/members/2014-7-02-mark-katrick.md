Rev. Mark Katrick has been the pastor of St. John's United Church of Christ since January of 2009. One of the original members of the South Newark Civic Association Board, he was born in Elyria, Ohio and is a graduate of Oberlin College and Ashland Theological Seminary. He is married to Laura Katrick and together they have six grown children and one grandchild. Mark's interests include reading, writing, listening to music, playing the guitar and piano. Rev. Katrick and the members and friends of his congregation are all very excited for this opportunity to serve and to further the SNCA's goal of "building harmony amongst the neighbors of South Newark."
