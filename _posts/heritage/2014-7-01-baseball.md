The sport of baseball is a rich part of our neighborhood. South Newark is fortunate to have many places of pride supporting baseball in our community. Mound City Little League was established in 1951 and offers a unique experience to any youth in Licking County. Don Edwards Park in Little Texas, the former home of the Babe Ruth World Series, is now the summer home of the Licking County Settlers, a collegiate league. There are many baseball fields throughout the neighborhood including Wells Park.
