The South End of Newark, Ohio is an area that is literally and figuratively made up of side streets. It is home to a variety of wonderful people, churches, and community organizations that have deep emotional ties in the area. These podcasts were produced by students enrolled in Denison University Professor Anne Crowley's “Technology & Learning” course. Professor Crowley has freely given the SNCA permission to share these stories.
