John Clem was one of the youngest Civil War heroes, born in 1851 in Newark. At nine years old, he ran away from home to enlist in the Union Army, but was turned down because he was so young. However, the army agreed to take him in as a drummer boy. He participated in many battles and became renowned for his bravery in combat. At twelve years old, he achieved the rank of sergeant, becoming the youngest noncommissioned officer to serve in the U.S. army. After rising to national fame, he served a long military career of almost fifty years before retiring. The Johnny Clem House, where many believe he lived as a boy, was at 26 W. Harrison Street in the South End.
